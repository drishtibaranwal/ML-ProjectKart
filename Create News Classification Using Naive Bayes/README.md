**News Classification Using Naive Bayes Algorithm**

Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.


Bayes Theorem :- 


Bayes’ Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. Bayes’ theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:

P(A|B) = {P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}

where A and B are events. 

 Correctly identifying the news into particular
category is still presenting challenge because of large and vast amount of features in the dataset. In regards to the existing
classifying approaches, Naïve Baye’s is potentially good at serving as a document classification model because Naïve
Baye’s model is very simple and is also potentially good due to its simplicity.

**Goal**


The goal of this project is to make a model which will classify articles or text into different news groups like religion, space, sports, politics etc. 

**Libraries Used**

1. numpy

2. matplotlib.pyplot

3. seaborn 

4. pandas

**What I Have Done** 

1. Loading the required libraries

2. Defining categories

3. Training the data on these categories

4. Testing the data on these categories

5. Importing neccesary packages

6. Creating model based on multinomial Naive Bayes

7.  Training the model with the train data

8. Create labels for test data

9. Predicting category of new data based on trained model 

10. Use Case 


**CONCLUSION**

We are able to find the accurate category of the news
